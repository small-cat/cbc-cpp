\subsection{Detailed Description}
The interface for defining strategies to deal with syntax errors encountered during a parse by A\+N\+T\+L\+R-\/generated parsers. We distinguish between three different kinds of errors\+: 


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The parser could not figure out which path to take in the A\+TN (none of the available alternatives could possibly match) 
\item The current input does not match what we were looking for 
\item A predicate evaluated to false 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Implementations of this interface report syntax errors by calling \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See also}
Parser\+::notify\+Error\+Listeners


\end{DoxySeeAlso}
.
