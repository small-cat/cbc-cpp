Just throw an exception not under RecognitionExceptionand Java will naturally toss you all the way out of the recognizers. If you want to continue lexing then you should not throw an exception to the parserâ€“it has already requested a token. Keep lexing until you get a valid one. Just report errors and keep going, looking for a valid token. " alt="" coords="130,5,269,32"/>
